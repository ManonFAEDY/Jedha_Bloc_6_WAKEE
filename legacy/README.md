# Welcome to the legacy folder! :older_man:

The content of this folder includes some of our older work files for readability, before Streamlit integration.

This folder is primarily aimed at tech-savvy people, should you want to reuse our work and fine-tune it yourself!

**Make sure** to install locally the libraries found under requirements.txt to avoid version issues.
Should your webcam not start, it may be tied to your confidentiality parameters pertaining either to your user account, either your web browser. Remember to enable access to your webcam!

Recovering them, you will then be able to edit them using your favorite IDE. You will thus find here:
* The three core scripts,
* The CNN notebooks,
* And finally the CNN training files.

Happy coding! :rocket:
